Some ideas or general strategies to try out when stuck.

# Operation-based problems
- can operations be simplified or re-framed?
- when is each type of operation necessary?

# Narrowing down possible answers
- Try to bound the answer or enumerate the possible answers
- What conditions result in certain answers?

# Other
- Parity of certain variables/quantities
- Inversions?
