Solve for `ax^2 + bx + c = kx`.

The discriminant becomes `(b-k)^2 - 4ac`.

If we find a line with `k` such that this discriminant becomes negative, this line can be used for this parabola.

If `4ac` is negative, the discriminant will always be positive, so no line will work for this parabola.

Otherwise, we solve for `k` and then search for any suitable line. There may be a range of suitable values for `k`, in this case we can search for any line within that range.
