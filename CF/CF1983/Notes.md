Notes on solutions/approaches to problems

# A
The indices themselves will always satsify this rule, so we can just have `a[i] = i` for all `i`.

# B
In each operation, two rows each get one of its elements increased by 1 (modulo 3), and one of its elements by 2 (modulo 3). Same with columns.

In other words, each row and column must have the same sum modulo 3 in the initial and final grids, or it is not possible.

We know this is necessary. How do we know it is sufficient? (it is)
